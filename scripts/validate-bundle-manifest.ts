/**
 * Validate that the committed per-scene bundle-size manifest is up to date.
 *
 * A PR that changes runtime code (or scenes) such that per-scene bundle sizes
 * move MUST also commit the regenerated per-scene manifest files under
 * `lab/public/bundle/manifest/<scene>.json`. GUIDANCE.md makes this mandatory so
 * reviewers can see size deltas in the diff and the tracked baseline stays in
 * sync with the code. The manifest is distributed (one file per scene) so PRs
 * touching different scenes do not collide on a single shared manifest file.
 *
 * This script is meant to run in CI AFTER `pnpm build:bundle-scenes`, which
 * overwrites the working-tree per-scene files with freshly measured sizes. It
 * compares those freshly built files against the versions committed at `git
 * HEAD`. Raw size uses `rawBytes` with a 10-byte freshness tolerance for global
 * minifier-allocation shifts; the subsequent bundle ceiling test still checks
 * every freshly built scene's exact bytes. gzip permits one rounded KB because
 * its output varies with the zlib build.
 *
 * It also compares each scene's logical `runtimeChunks` set after removing
 * Vite's content hashes. Added or removed runtime features remain visible, while
 * content-hash-only churn does not force unrelated manifest rewrites. Exact
 * `rawBytes` still catches every runtime-size movement.
 *
 * Exit code 1 (with a helpful message) when the committed manifest is stale.
 *
 * Usage: npx tsx scripts/validate-bundle-manifest.ts
