/**
 * Shared ceiling-headroom arithmetic for the bundle-size build log and the PR comment.
 *
 * Headroom is the distance between a scene's measured runtime size and its `maxRawKB`
 * ceiling in `scene-config.json`. The ceiling check itself is absolute and lives elsewhere
 * (`tests/lite/parity/bundle-size.spec.ts` and `reportCeilingHeadroom` in
 * `bundle-scenes-core.ts`); nothing here decides whether a build passes or fails. This
 * module exists so the two places that *report* headroom — a build log and a GitHub
 * comment — cannot drift apart on thresholds or on the rounding rules below.
 *
 * ## Why headroom is worth reporting at all
 *
 * The ceilings are, in practice, ratchets pinned to whatever each scene measured when it
 * was last touched, not budgets with slack. Measured across the 241 scenes that have both a
 * size and a ceiling, from ADO build 58227 — the first run to measure every scene at a single
 * master commit rather than relying on per-scene manifests each author regenerated at a
 * different time:
 *
 *   median headroom   1536 B      p25   205 B      p10   113 B
 *   under  256 B       71 scenes (29%)
 *   under 1024 B      105 scenes (44%)
 *   under 2048 B      131 scenes (54%)
 *
 * Re-measured later against the published baseline artifact at master `c5f8f660` (243 scenes,
 * 0 over ceiling), which is a different instrument from the one above — a CDN-hosted manifest
 * rather than a build's own output:
 *
 *   median headroom   1825 B      p25   471 B      p10   360 B
 *   under  256 B        4 scenes ( 2%)
 *   under 1024 B       97 scenes (40%)
 *   under 2048 B      127 scenes (52%)
 *
 * Both vintages are kept deliberately. The body of the distribution barely moved — 44% → 40%
 * under 1 KB, 54% → 52% under 2 KB — while the extreme tail collapsed, from 71 scenes under
 * 256 B to 4. A core-engine deletion recovering a few hundred bytes across many scenes at
 * once does exactly that: it lifts the scenes nearest their ceilings without changing the
 * shape of the rest. That is the same shared-path leverage this report exists to warn about,
 * observed in the safe direction. Keeping both readings is the point — a threshold justified
 * by a single snapshot cannot be told apart from one fitted to it.
 *
 * The tightest scene on master sits 9 bytes below its ceiling, in both measurements.
 *
 * That distribution is what makes concurrent PRs dangerous. Two PRs can each measure under
 * a ceiling — each was built against a master that did not contain the other — and breach
 * it together once both land. Azure DevOps builds the *merge commit* for a PR, so once
 * master is over a ceiling, every subsequent PR's Bundle Size job fails until the bytes are
 * recovered. The recovery options are emergency size work or raising a ceiling, and raising
 * a ceiling requires explicit user approval (see GUIDANCE.md). Making headroom visible at
 * review time is what lets an author notice they are in the danger zone and serialize on
 * purpose instead of discovering it from a repo-wide stall.

/**
 * Headroom below which a scene is reported as tight.
 *
 * Chosen as one kilobyte because that is exactly the granularity at which the existing
 * reporting goes blind: the PR delta table rounds every size to a whole KB, so a scene with
 * less than 1 KB of headroom can be pushed over its ceiling by a change the table renders as
 * `0 KB` or `+1 KB`. Below this line an author cannot see the risk from the numbers they are
 * shown, which is precisely where a warning earns its place.
 *
 * It is also where the population splits, and it stays there across both measurements above:
 * 1 KB flags the tight 44% / 40% and stays quiet about the roomy half, against a median of
 * 1536 B / 1825 B. That stability is the argument for it — the threshold's coverage barely
 * moved while the sub-256 B band collapsed from 71 scenes to 4, so 1 KB is tracking where
 * near-ceiling scenes actually sit rather than tracking one snapshot's tail.
 *
 * The previous value of 256 B is what that collapse disqualifies. It was already arbitrary —
 * a point well inside the risk band that said nothing about the ~1 KB range where most
 * near-ceiling scenes live — but it has since become nearly silent as well, flagging 4 scenes
 * where it once flagged 71. A threshold whose coverage can fall by a factor of seventeen
 * without anyone changing it is not reporting a risk level; it is reporting the tail's
 * position. Raising further was rejected in the other direction: 2 KB flags 52-54% of scenes
 * and 4 KB flags 67-72%, at which point the warning is wallpaper nobody reads.
 *
 * This is a WARNING threshold. It is not a ceiling and it never fails a build.

/**
 * Inner band, reported as a count alongside the tight count.
 *
 * This is the old tight threshold, kept rather than deleted: at under a quarter kilobyte a
 * scene is not merely at risk from an unrelated shared-path change, it is effectively
 * guaranteed to move with the next one. Splitting the report into "tight" and "critical"
 * keeps that emergency signal legible now that the outer band is four times wider.

 * the output a constant size no matter how the flagged set grows, so widening the threshold
 * changes the numbers in the report without changing how much of it there is to read.
 *
 * Build 58227 shows the failure this avoids: at the old 256 B threshold its log already had to
 * truncate, printing ten scenes and then "… and 61 more under 256 B".
