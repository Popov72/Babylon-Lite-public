 * makes a specific concurrency failure easy to hit: two PRs each measure under a ceiling
 * against a master that lacks the other, then breach it together once both land. Because CI
 * builds the merge commit, master being over a ceiling fails *every* later PR's Bundle Size
 * job until the bytes are recovered, and raising a ceiling needs explicit approval.
 *
 * The build log already computed this, but a ~42-minute job's log is not where anyone looks.
 * Putting it in the comment is what turns it into something an author acts on — so the scenes
 * *this PR moved* are called out uncollapsed, and the repo-wide picture is folded away.
 *
 * "Moved" means moved *toward* the ceiling. Direction matters and the first run against a real
 * baseline is what proved it: a branch that had merged a size-reducing master change showed 94
 * scenes in the uncollapsed block, every one of them shrinking (many by 46 B), because presence
 * in the moved set was tested with `has()` rather than by sign. A scene that got smaller gained
 * headroom — it cannot be pushed over its ceiling by this PR, and it was already tight before it
 * was touched. Reporting it as actionable inverts the signal: it asks the author to look hardest
 * at the changes that helped. Only increases can consume headroom, so only increases are called
 * out here; shrinking scenes still appear in the collapsed repo-wide list if they are tight.
 *
 * Scenes *already* over their ceiling are reported whether or not this PR touched them. Filtering
 * the over-ceiling set by direction the way the tight set is filtered would have made this section
 * silent in the one situation it was built for: once master is breached, the Bundle Size job fails
 * on every open PR, and none of those authors grew the offending scene. The delta-comment step
 * runs `condition: always()`, so it is still generated on exactly those failing builds — it just
 * had nothing to say about the failure. An inherited breach is therefore called out separately
 * from one this PR caused, so the author can tell "you did this" from "this was already broken".
 *
 * That attribution is made from the *baseline measurement*, not from a movement delta, because
 * movement answers a different question and gets both edges wrong. A scene this branch adds is
 * absent from the baseline, so it has no delta at all and reads as inherited — asserting it was
 * already over on master, of a scene that does not exist there. A scene that is genuinely
 * inherited acquires a delta the moment the branch grows it by a single byte, which a shared-path
 * change does across many scenes at once — and then the whole overage is attributed to the author
 * and the "rebasing will not clear this" note disappears, in the middle of the repo-wide stall
 * that note exists for. Only the baseline can distinguish the two, so only the baseline is asked.
