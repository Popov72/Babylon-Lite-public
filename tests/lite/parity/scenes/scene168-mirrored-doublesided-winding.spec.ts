/**
 * Scene 168 — Mirrored Double-Sided Winding Parity Test.
 *
 * Two identical double-sided quads under an IBL, one of them under a negative-scale node so its
 * net world determinant is positive and its triangle winding reversed relative to the loader's
 * RH->LH `__root__` flip.
 *
 * A mirrored mesh must have its pipeline `frontFace` flipped ccw->cw. WebGPU derives
 * `@builtin(front_facing)` from `frontFace`, and the double-sided PBR shader flips the shading
 * normal on fragments that are not front-facing, so the wrong winding inverts the outward normal
 * on the visible side. Babylon.js flips `sideOrientation` for the same reason, which is why its
 * reference shades both quads consistently — and why a build that loses the winding misses it.
 *
 * This scene exists because the mirrored-node scenes that came before it (257 / 266 / 269) do NOT
 * catch the failure: their mirrored meshes render pixel-identically whether the winding is applied
 * or not (verified by forcing the wrong winding and re-rendering). It is also specifically a
 * BUNDLED-build regression — the winding used to be installed through a bare side-effect import
 * that the scene bundler tree-shakes away, so a source build always looked correct.
 *
 * Static scene; golden captured from BJS.
 *
 * Assertions:
 * - Full image MAD ≤ maxMad
 * - Foreground region MAD ≤ maxRegionMad
