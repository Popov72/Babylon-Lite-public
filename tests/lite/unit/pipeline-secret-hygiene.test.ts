 * while its justification was a property of one file's content -- and the
 * directory holds exactly one file today, so scope and reason coincide by
 * population size rather than by construction. The second workflow to be added
 * inherits an exemption it may not have earned, and nothing fires.
 *
 * Deliberately not "must say DEPLOY_TOKEN", which is the Azure convention and
 * would reject correct Actions code. The property asserted here is the one both
 * conventions share: a credential in a header came from the secret store, not
 * from the file. A workflow that authenticates some third way still passes, as
 * long as its secret is a secret.
 *
 * The trace is needed because the binding is rarely direct. The live case is
 * two hops -- `AUTH` is built from `ADO_PAT`, which is `${{ secrets.ADO_PAT }}`
 * -- so a one-level check would report the real exempt file as unbound and the
 * guard would arrive red on a correct tree.
