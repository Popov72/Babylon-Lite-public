 *
 * The two sides of the terminator are measured separately and only one of them

 * structure, or the block runs on and swallows `displayName` and the whole
 * `env:` block underneath it — the exact text whose absence is what makes the
 * caller's check mean anything, and the caller floors it. The line side uses the
 * raw indent because inside a block scalar a leading `- ` is literal text rather
 * than a sequence marker; no step in this pipeline has a body line beginning
 * with `- ` at the key's column, so no input here separates that choice from the
 * other one. Recorded rather than defended with a contrived arm.
 *
 * Literal `|` only, not `[|>]`. No step here uses a folded `script: >` and a
 * branch no input reaches is a branch nobody has checked; the caller floors the
 * empty return instead, which gives an accurate message on the day someone
 * writes one rather than a misleading one about variables going unmentioned.
 *
 * Comment lines are stripped, so what this returns is what the shell runs.
 * Measured before it did: commenting out this check's 46 body lines and leaving
 * a live `exit 1` behind returned 10 passed, with every variable name still
 * "mentioned" and the check checking nothing. The block is still terminated on
 * the raw lines, because a YAML comment sitting at the key's column really does

 * mutated sixteen decisions in this file one at a time. Thirteen were silent.
 * The three that fired were all inside `isMappingEntry`/`valueShape` — the only
 * predicate in the file that already had a specimen table. Everything else was
 * floored solely by "the guard still passes on the one real pipeline", which is
 * a single input, and a single input cannot separate a predicate from a looser
 * or tighter one that agrees with it on that input.
 *
 * The sharpest one, and the reason the table starts with comments: loosening
 * `isCommentLine` from `/^\s*#/` to `/#/` — strip any line *containing* a hash —
 * left 10 passed. A live command with a trailing comment then vanishes from
 * `commandLines`, so `pnpm build:bundle-scenes # measures the bundles` is a step
 * the cost clause cannot see. That helper was added one commit ago to kill a
 * false positive, and it acquired a false-negative mode in the dangerous
 * direction: when a predicate is written to suppress an over-report, every
 * specimen you think of covers the over-reporting direction.
 *
 * No oracle. Unlike NESTING_SPECIMENS, whose verdicts come from PyYAML, these
 * are design judgements about what this repository's pipelines mean, so the
