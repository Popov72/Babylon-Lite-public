/**
 * `build-perf-baseline.ts` checks the baseline ref out into a worktree and then copies
 * a hand-maintained list of `scripts/` files over it, so the baseline is measured with
 * the *current* bundle builder rather than a historical one.
 *
 * That list is a manual mirror of an import graph, which is exactly the kind of coupling
 * that rots silently: extracting a helper out of bundle-scenes-core.ts leaves the list
 * stale, and nothing complains until the perf job — the slowest job in the pipeline, and
 * one that only runs in CI — dies with "Cannot find module './<helper>'". Every other
 * consumer builds from a full checkout where the file is simply present, so local runs,
 * unit tests, and the bundle-size job all stay green while perf is broken.
 *
 * This test closes that gap statically: it recomputes the import closure from the source
 * and fails in milliseconds, at the moment the helper is extracted.
