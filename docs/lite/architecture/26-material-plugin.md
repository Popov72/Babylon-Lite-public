# Module: material-plugin

> Package path: `packages/babylon-lite/src/material/plugin/`

## Purpose

Public, **opt-in** material-plugin support — the Babylon-Lite equivalent of BJS
`MaterialPluginBase`. A plugin layers custom WGSL + uniforms + samplers onto an
existing **PBR** or **Standard** material while keeping the full built-in
lighting / IBL / shadow pipeline. Plugins are plain-data objects (GUIDANCE §4b′),
attached per-instance via `material.plugins = [plugin]`.

Plugin support is an **explicit opt-in**: the application imports and calls
`enableMaterialPlugins(scene)` (after creating materials/meshes, before
`registerScene`). That call is the only thing that pulls the plugin bridges and
their WGSL into a scene's module graph. Shared Standard binding infrastructure
only propagates its existing owning `SceneContext` through the generic extension
hook, allowing opt-in state to remain truly scene-local.

## Public API Surface

```ts
// material/plugin/material-plugin.ts (all type-only — erased at build)
export type MaterialPluginPoint =
    | "CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_DEFINITIONS"
    | "CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_MAIN_BEGIN"
    | "CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_UPDATE_ALPHA"
    | "CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_UPDATE_DIFFUSE"
    | "CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_BEFORE_LIGHTS"
    | "CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_BEFORE_FINALCOLORCOMPOSITION"
    | "CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_BEFORE_FRAGCOLOR"
    | "CUSTOM_VERTEX_MAIN_BEGIN"
    | "CUSTOM_VERTEX_UPDATE_WORLDPOS"
    | "CUSTOM_VERTEX_MAIN_END";

export interface PluginUboField {
    readonly name: string;
    readonly type: string;
} // WGSL type verbatim
export interface PluginSamplerDecl {
    readonly texture: string;
    readonly sampler: string;
    readonly textureType?: "texture_2d<f32>";
    readonly samplerType?: "sampler" | "sampler_non_filtering";
}
export interface PluginTextureBinding {
    readonly texture: Texture2D;
} // no GPU handles (§4d)

export interface MaterialPlugin {
    readonly name: string;
    priority?: number; // lower runs first; default 500
    isEnabled?: boolean; // default true when attached
    dynamic?: boolean; // refresh Standard-material UBO values every frame
    defines?: Record<string, boolean | number>;
    getCustomCode?(shaderType: "vertex" | "fragment"): Partial<Record<MaterialPluginPoint, string>> | null;
    getUniforms?(): { ubo?: PluginUboField[] };
    getSamplers?(): PluginSamplerDecl[];
    writeUbo?(data: Float32Array, offsets: ReadonlyMap<string, number>): void;
    bindTextures?(out: PluginTextureBinding[]): void;
    getActiveTextures?(out: Texture2D[]): void;
}

// material/material.ts
interface Material {
    /* … */ plugins?: MaterialPlugin[];
}
```

Public exports (`index.ts`): `MaterialPlugin`, `MaterialPluginPoint`,
`PluginUboField`, `PluginSamplerDecl`, `PluginTextureBinding` (all `export type`),
plus the runtime functions `enableMaterialPlugins(scene)` and
`bakeStdPluginMaterial(material, scene)`.

## Opt-in entry point — `enableMaterialPlugins(scene)`

```ts
const mat = createStandardMaterial();
mat.plugins = [myPlugin]; // attach (any number of materials)
box.material = mat;
addToScene(scene, box);

enableMaterialPlugins(scene); // ← the ONLY thing that loads plugin code
await registerScene(scene);
```

`enableMaterialPlugins` (`material/plugin/enable-material-plugins.ts`) statically
imports both bridges (legitimate — it is itself only reachable when the app calls
it) and:

1. Registers the **PBR** plugin ext (`registerPbrPlugins`) and **Standard** plugin
   ext (`registerStdPlugins`) into the global `_getPbrExts()` / `_getStdExts()`
   registries. The pre-existing renderable hook loops then invoke them with **zero
   shared-code changes**.
2. For **Standard** plugin materials only (filtered by `_buildGroup ===
standardGroupBuilder`, so PBR materials are never touched), walks `scene.meshes`
   and pre-bakes the per-signature index into
   `mat._renderFeatures = { features: _computeStandardMaterialFeatures(mat) | (idx<<24) }`.
   This is required because Standard's `_computeStandardMaterialFeatures` is not
   ext-extensible, so the index must be baked in before the build reads it. PBR
   needs no walk — its `detect` hook encodes the index during feature computation.
   Standard materials created after this walk can be registered explicitly with
   `bakeStdPluginMaterial(material, scene)`. Materials without plugins are left
   untouched, so their normal lazy feature detection remains live until build.

The plugin implementation remains outside the always-loaded PBR/Standard graph;
only the generic Standard binding hook carries scene ownership context.

## Injection-point → Lite slot mapping

| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

| CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_BEFORE_FRAGCOLOR             | BC                      | after tonemap+gamma (demo uses this) |
| CUSTOM_VERTEX_MAIN_BEGIN                     | VR                      |                                      |
| CUSTOM_VERTEX_UPDATE_WORLDPOS                | VW                      |                                      |
| CUSTOM_VERTEX_MAIN_END                       | VB                      |                                      |

Only **existing** template slots are reused — no new `/*XX*/` markers are added
(that would grow every PBR/Standard scene's template). At the `BC` slot the color
variable is named `color` in both PBR (`vec3<f32>`) and Standard (`vec4<f32>`),
so per-component writes (`color.r = …`) work for both families.

The `RegisterMaterialPlugin` global auto-attach from BJS is intentionally **not**
implemented — it would require module-level side effects (forbidden, GUIDANCE §4).
Use per-instance `material.plugins = [...]`.

## Internal Architecture (bridge data flow)

```
material.plugins ──► enableMaterialPlugins(scene) ──► {pbr,std}-plugin-bridge ──► PbrExt / StdExt
                                                        │
                                  plugin-bridge-shared.ts
                                  ├─ pluginSignature(plugins)  → stable cache key string
                                  ├─ buildPluginFragment(plugins, idx, forStandard) → { _fragment, _stdUboSpec }
                                  │     getCustomCode → _fragmentSlots / _vertexSlots / _helperFunctions
                                  │     getUniforms.ubo → _uboFields (PBR) | self-managed `pluginUbo` binding (Standard)
                                  │     getSamplers → _bindings (texture+sampler pairs)
                                  ├─ writePluginUbo  → plugin.writeUbo(data, offsets)
                                  └─ bindPluginTextures → plugin.bindTextures → GPU entries
```

A single bridge extension handles all plugins on a material. Each distinct plugin
**signature** (name + priority + isEnabled + defines + custom code + uniforms +
samplers of every attached plugin) is assigned a small **index**. PBR stores that
index separately on `Material._pi`, so it cannot collide with native `features2`
bits; Standard stores it in `features` bits 24..30. Both families include the
index in their compose/pipeline cache keys, so any plugin change — including
enabling/disabling — produces a distinct shader variant.

### PBR (`pbr-plugin-bridge.ts`)

A `PbrExt { id: "plugin", phase: "fragment" }` registered via `_registerPbrExt`:

- `detect(mat)` lazily assigns `mat._pi` and contributes no native feature bits.
- `frag(ctx)` resolves the fragment for `ctx._pi`.
- `writeUbo(data, mat, offsets)` → plugin UBO slices into the **material UBO**
  (PBR template has `_baseMaterialUboFields`, so fragment `_uboFields` target it;
  WGSL access is `material.<field>`).
- `bind` / `textures` → samplers + acquire/release.
  All five hooks are already iterated over the global `_getPbrExts()` registry by
  the core (detect in `_computePbrMaterialFeatures`, frag in `pbr-compose`, writeUbo
  in `writeMaterialData`, bind in `createPbrMeshBindGroup`, textures in
  `collectPbrBoundTextures`), so **no core PBR file is modified at all** —
  `enableMaterialPlugins` simply registers the ext before the build runs.

### Standard (`std-plugin-bridge.ts`)

A `StdExt { _id: "plugin", _phase: "mesh", _feature: 0x7f << 24 }` registered via
`_registerStdExt`. Standard has no per-ext `detect` hook and a fixed-layout
material UBO, so the bridge:

- pre-bakes the signature index into each plugin material's cached
  `_renderFeatures.features` (`_computeStandardMaterialFeatures(mat) | (idx<<24)`),
  done in `registerStdPlugins` for Standard materials only,
- delivers plugin uniforms through a **self-managed uniform buffer**, _not_ the
  mesh UBO. `buildPluginFragment(plugins, idx, /*forStandard*/ true)` emits a
  dedicated `var<uniform> pluginUbo : pluginUboUniforms;` fragment binding (struct
  declared in `_helperFunctions`) instead of appending `_uboFields` to the mesh
  UBO. The bridge builds one `GPUBuffer` per material, so materials with the same
  shader signature can retain different uniform values, and pushes its bind entry
  from `StdExt._bind` — **before** the texture entries, matching the binding
  declaration order — followed by `bindPluginTextures`.

Standard plugins marked `dynamic: true` have their per-material UBO values
rewritten before every frame. Dynamic tracking and UBO ownership are scoped to
the enabling scene, so enabling a second scene does not replace the first
scene's refresh state. The Standard bind builders pass the owning scene into the
plugin extension, so one material shared by multiple scenes resolves each
scene's distinct UBO; disposing either scene cannot invalidate the other's
binding. Static plugins retain the registration-time upload. Re-baking a
material queues every affected mesh for a material-swap rebuild. The old UBO's
release is attached to those renderables' existing disposer packets. Async
per-mesh and full-group rebuilds expose the packets they temporarily remove from
`scene._meshDisposables`, so a re-bake during either window can attach to the
same pending teardown. The old buffer therefore remains valid while the swap
queue or an async group build is blocked. Only after every affected replacement
bind group has been committed is the old buffer retired behind a subsequent GPU
fence. Disposing the scene
destroys all of its remaining plugin UBOs and releases the material references
held by the bridge.

The decisive benefit: this route adds no `_writeUbo` hook or plugin UBO loop to
the Standard renderable. The pre-existing `StdExt._bind` / `_textures` loops in
`standard-pipeline.ts` / `collect-std-bound-textures.ts` and the `_frag` loop in
`standard-renderable.ts` carry the plugin; the bind hook receives the owning
scene so scene-local UBO state can be selected. WGSL access to a Standard plugin
uniform is `pluginUbo.<field>` (PBR access is `material.<field>`).

## Pipeline Configuration / Cache Keying

- PBR compose, binding, and geometry-output cache keys include `Material._pi`,
  which differentiates plugin variants without consuming native feature bits.
- PBR pipeline + bindings also include `_fragmentKey` (sorted fragment ids); the
  plugin fragment id is `plugin-<index>`, matched back to the ext in
  `createPbrMeshBindGroup` via `fid.startsWith("plugin-")`.
- Standard feature key: `_standardFeatureKey(features, …)` → plugin index in
  `features` differentiates variants.

## Shader Logic (demo: BlackAndWhite grayscale)

Injected at `CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_BEFORE_FRAGCOLOR` → `BC` (after tonemap + gamma):

```wgsl
let bwLuma = dot(color.rgb, vec3<f32>(0.3, 0.59, 0.11));
color.r = bwLuma; color.g = bwLuma; color.b = bwLuma;
```

The BJS reference plugin injects the equivalent at the same point on `finalColor`
(PBR) / `color` (Standard). Since the pre-grayscale color is already parity-matched
and grayscale is a linear reduction, the result stays pixel-identical.

## State Machine / Lifecycle

1. User sets `material.plugins = [plugin]`, calls `enableMaterialPlugins(scene)`,
   then `registerScene`.
2. `enableMaterialPlugins` registers the PBR + Standard plugin exts into the global
   registries (Standard additionally pre-bakes feature bits for its materials and
   builds any self-managed plugin UBOs).
3. Per mesh: detect (PBR) / pre-baked features (Standard) assign the signature index
   → compose builds WGSL with the plugin fragment → pipeline/bind groups created →
   UBO + textures bound.
4. **Toggle/re-bake:** set `plugin.isEnabled`, then call
   `bakeStdPluginMaterial(material, scene)`. The new signature index yields a
   fresh pipeline; affected bindings are rebuilt through the scene's material
   swap queue, and the replaced plugin UBO is retired safely. Removing the last
   plugin clears the cached Standard features only when that scene actually had
   an existing plugin state; plugin-free materials are never eagerly cached by
   `enableMaterialPlugins`.
5. **Dispose:** `disposeScene(scene)` destroys every remaining Standard plugin
   UBO owned by that scene and drops its per-material refresh state.

## Dependencies

- `shader/fragment-types.ts` (ShaderFragment, slots, UboField, BindingDecl)
- `material/pbr/pbr-flags.ts` (PbrExt), `material/standard/standard-flags.ts` (StdExt)
- `texture/texture-2d.ts` (Texture2D)

## Test Specification

- Scene 217 (`scene217-material-plugin`): a PBR sphere **and** a Standard box, each
  with the BlackAndWhite plugin enabled, validated against a BJS golden using an
  equivalent `MaterialPluginBase` BlackAndWhite plugin. MAD ≤ `scene-config.maxMad`.
- Unit coverage verifies independent dynamic refresh state across two scenes,
  scene-disposal cleanup, shared-material scene isolation, lazy plugin-free
  feature detection, and replacement-UBO rebinding/retirement when a Standard
  material is baked again while the material-swap queue is blocked, including
  per-mesh and full-group async-build windows where `_meshDisposables`
  temporarily has no packet.
- Bundle-size: `bundle-size.spec.ts` guards the generic scene-context propagation
  and verifies the plugin implementation remains absent from plugin-free scene
  graphs.

## File Manifest

- `material/plugin/material-plugin.ts` — public types.
- `material/plugin/plugin-bridge-shared.ts` — signature + fragment builder
  (`forStandard` chooses mesh-UBO `_uboFields` vs self-managed `pluginUbo` binding)
    - UBO/texture helpers.
- `material/plugin/pbr-plugin-bridge.ts` — PBR `PbrExt`.
- `material/plugin/std-plugin-bridge.ts` — Standard `StdExt` + self-managed UBO.
- `material/plugin/enable-material-plugins.ts` — the opt-in entry point.
- Shared Standard binding edits: `standard-flags.ts`, `standard-pipeline.ts`,
  `standard-renderable.ts`, `standard-geometry-renderable.ts`, and
  `fragments/std-uv-transform-fragment.ts` propagate `SceneContext` through the
  generic bind hook. No shared plugin state or plugin-specific binding loop is
  added.
