# Module: Scene

> Package path: `packages/babylon-lite/src/scene/scene.ts`

## Purpose

The Scene module defines `SceneContext` — the central, flat data container for all rendering state. It follows a strict one-way ownership model with no circular references: the scene holds references to the engine, camera, lights, and meshes, but none of those reference the scene back. The scene is material-agnostic — it delegates all pipeline/bind-group creation to material-owned builders via the `_buildGroup` pattern. It also provides `createDefaultCamera()` which computes an ArcRotateCamera auto-framed around loaded meshes' bounding boxes.

## Internal Architecture

### SceneContext — Flat Data Struct

`createSceneContext(engine, options?)` returns a plain object with these defaults. By default it also appends the swapchain render task named `"scene"`; pass `{ defaultRenderTask: false }` when the caller will provide the final swapchain task explicitly, such as a post-process chain.

### Design Principle: One-Way Ownership

```
Engine ← SceneContext → Camera
                      → Lights[]
                      → Meshes[]
                      → AnimationGroups[]
                      → ShadowGenerators[]
                      → _renderables[]
                      → _prePasses[]
                      → _uniformUpdaters[]
                      → _beforeRender[]
```

No child objects reference the scene. The engine iterates the renderable arrays as opaque contracts.

### `addToScene()` — Entity Routing

`addToScene(scene, entity)` inspects the entity and routes it to the correct collection:

```typescript
function addToScene(scene: SceneContext, entity: Mesh | LightBase | ShadowGenerator | TransformNode | AssetContainer) {
    // AssetContainer — from loadGltf() or loadBabylon()
    if ("entities" in entity) {
        const result = entity as AssetContainer;
        for (const e of result.entities) addToScene(scene, e); // recurse into individual entities
        if (result.clearColor) ctx.clearColor = result.clearColor;
        if (result.animationGroups?.length) {
            const engine = ctx.engine as EngineContextInternal;
            const groups = result.animationGroups;
            ctx.animationGroups.push(...groups);
            ctx._beforeRender.push((dt) => {
                for (const g of groups) tickAnimation(g, dt, engine);
            });
        }
        return;
    }
    if (isTransformNode(entity)) {
        // TransformNode: collect all meshes from hierarchy and add each
        const meshes = collectMeshes(entity, entity.parent ?? undefined);
        for (const m of meshes) {
            ctx.add(m);
        }
        return;
    }
    if ("_gpu" in entity && "material" in entity) {
        // Mesh → meshes + register material builder (deduped by builder identity)
        this.meshes.push(entity);
        // Subscribe this scene to the mesh. A mesh never references the scene (one-way
        // ownership), so the reverse index lives off the mesh in a lazily-allocated
        // `WeakMap<Mesh, Set<SceneContext>>`. The `mesh.material` setter is installed
        // exactly once (on the mesh's first registration); the captured subscriber set is
        // mutated in place, so a mesh shared across scenes notifies ALL of them on swap.
        // The set's size also ref-counts the mesh's shared GPU buffers: disposeScene /
        // removeFromScene only call disposeMeshGpu on the LAST scene removal.
        registerMeshScene(this, entity);
        const builder = entity.material?._buildGroup;
        if (builder && !_groups.has(builder)) {
            _groups.set(builder, []);
            this._deferredBuilders.push(async () => {
                const result = await builder(this, _groups.get(builder)!);
                this._renderables.push(...result.renderables);
                if (result.updater) this._uniformUpdaters.push(result.updater);
            });
        }
        _groups.get(builder)?.push(entity);
    } else {
        // Light → lights
        this.lights.push(entity as LightBase);
    }
}
```

The `AssetContainer` branch is checked first (via `'entities' in entity`). For `glTF` results, `entities` contains a single root `TransformNode` — the TransformNode branch then calls `collectMeshes` to pull all child meshes into the scene. For `.babylon` results, `entities` is flat `[...meshes, ...lights]`, dispatched directly.

The scene never branches on material type (PBR vs standard). Materials self-describe their builder via `material._buildGroup`, and the scene groups meshes by builder identity using an internal `Map<MeshGroupBuilder, Mesh[]>`. Each unique builder is registered as a deferred builder exactly once.

### Mesh GPU Lifetime — `removeFromScene` Contract

A mesh's GPU resources (geometry `_gpu`, skeleton, morph targets, thin instances) are **shared and ref-counted** (`resource/ref-count.ts`): several scenes may hold the same mesh, `cloneTransformNode` shares buffers with its clone, and the glTF loader shares one geometry across nodes referencing the same primitive.

- `removeFromScene(scene, mesh)` / `disposeScene(scene)` unregister the scene from the mesh (`unregisterMeshScene`). Only when the mesh leaves its **last** scene is `disposeMeshGpu(mesh)` called, which releases the mesh's claim on each shared resource. Removing a mesh from one of several scenes holding it is not a disposal — re-adding it there is fine. `disposeMeshGpu` is also public, so calling it directly disposes the mesh the same way, whether or not it ever belonged to a scene.
- Each resource's buffers are destroyed when that release was the **last** claim on it; resources still owned by a clone or another glTF node survive.
- **Disposal is terminal, for the mesh.** `disposeMeshGpu` marks the mesh `_disposed` and returns early on any repeat call, so the idempotent `removeFromScene` never releases a claim twice (a second release would report the surviving clone's claim as the last one and destroy buffers still in use). `addToScene` throws for a disposed mesh from then on: `Mesh "<name>" cannot be added: it was disposed when it left its last scene. Create a new mesh instead.`, and `cloneTransformNode` likewise refuses it — a clone of a disposed mesh could never release the claims cloning retains. The flag is per-mesh, not per-resource, because both failure modes are per-mesh: a sole owner would draw with destroyed handles, while a shared owner would release a second claim it no longer holds and free buffers a surviving sibling still renders with. It also covers resources destroyed independently of the shared geometry (a per-node skeleton or morph target whose geometry is shared) and stale handles left behind by device-loss recovery, which only rebuilds meshes still in a scene.
- The guard runs before any scene state is mutated, so a rejected mesh add leaves the scene untouched. Adding a hierarchy or asset container is not transactional: entities processed before the offending mesh stay added.
- Removing a mesh you intend to show again is therefore never valid unless another scene still holds it. Otherwise build a new mesh. To hide a mesh temporarily, prefer `mesh.visible = false` / `setSubtreeVisible` over removing it.

### Deferred Building & `_buildGroup` Pattern

Materials carry a `_buildGroup: MeshGroupBuilder` function that knows how to create GPU pipelines, bind groups, and renderables for a batch of meshes sharing that material type. The flow:

1. `addToScene(scene, mesh)` groups the mesh by its `material._buildGroup` identity.
2. If this is the first mesh for a given builder, a deferred builder is registered.
3. At `buildScene(scene)` time (called by `registerScene()` before the frame graph is built), each deferred builder runs once with the full batch of meshes for that group.
4. Builders return `MeshGroupBuildResult`; `renderables` are pushed onto `_renderables`, and an optional `updater` is pushed onto `_uniformUpdaters` only when present.

`buildScene(scene)` is async — deferred builders may return `Promise<void>` for GPU resource creation.

This decouples scene setup from GPU resource creation, ensures all assets are loaded before pipelines are built, and keeps scene.ts entirely material-agnostic.

### Runtime Adds & Removals (after `registerScene`)

Deferred builders only run at boot, inside `buildScene()`. Anything added afterwards goes through the
per-frame material-swap queue (`processMaterialSwaps`, drained from the scene's `_update` hook), which
covers two distinct cases:

- **The material's group already exists and has been built** (`group.r` is set) — the mesh's renderable
  is rebuilt synchronously in that same frame, so there is no missing-mesh flash.
- **The material's group has never been built** — either the mesh is the FIRST of its material family in
  this scene, or `mesh.material` was reassigned to a family with no group at all (the material setter only
  enqueues; it never creates a group). These are handed to the runtime build path
  (`scene-runtime-mesh-build.ts`, dynamically imported so static scenes do not bundle it), which
  materializes the group: PBR rebuilds the whole group via `rebuildScenePbrPipelines`, other families
  build the single mesh and install the group's rebuild function.

> **Introducing a material family at runtime is ASYNCHRONOUS.** It requires a dynamic module import plus
> shader compilation and a full group build, so the mesh becomes visible some frames after `addToScene`
> returns — `addToScene` itself returns `void` and offers no readiness signal. Adding at least one mesh of
> each material family before `registerScene` keeps everything synchronous. Build failures surface through
> the scene's before-render error hook rather than being swallowed.

`removeFromScene` mirrors this asymmetry on the teardown side: scene bookkeeping (list splices, group and
frame-graph eviction, renderable-version bump) is synchronous, but **GPU teardown is deferred** —
per-mesh/material UBOs, texture releases and shared geometry buffers are retired via `retireGpuResources`
and only destroyed after the next `queue.submit` has drained. This makes `removeFromScene` legal from
inside `onBeforeRender` (destroying mid-frame hits "Destroyed texture / Buffer used in a submit") and
preserves make-before-break for resources shared with another mesh: a rebuild re-acquires the texture
before the deferred release lands, so its ref count never dips to zero. Because the free is deferred, the
right to release a mesh's shared buffers is taken as a one-shot, revocable claim
(`claimMeshGpuDisposal` / `consumeMeshGpuDisposal`), so a repeat removal, a re-add, or a `disposeScene`
in between cannot free the same buffers twice.

### Hidden State (accessed via `(scene as any)`)

| Property       | Set by              | Type                  | Purpose                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `_envTextures` | `loadEnvironment()` | `EnvironmentTextures` | IBL cubemap + BRDF LUT                    |
| `_pbrSceneBGL` | PBR builder         | `GPUBindGroupLayout`  | PBR scene BGL for background reuse        |
| `_pbrSceneBG`  | PBR builder         | `GPUBindGroup`        | PBR scene bind group for background reuse |

> **Removed**: `_gpuMeshes` and the `GpuMesh` type no longer exist. Meshes carry their GPU data in `mesh._gpu` and their bounding boxes in `mesh.boundMin`/`mesh.boundMax` directly.

### Auto-Framing Camera (`createDefaultCamera`)

Algorithm:

1. Read `scene.meshes` (may be empty).
2. Compute world-space AABB across all meshes by iterating `boundMin`/`boundMax` on each `Mesh`.
3. Compute diagonal: `diag = √(sx² + sy² + sz²)` where `sx = maxX - minX`, etc.
4. Radius = `diag * 1.5` (Babylon formula).
5. Center = midpoint of AABB.
6. If radius is 0 or non-finite: radius = 1, center = (0,0,0).
7. Create camera: `alpha = -π/2`, `beta = π/2`, `radius`, `target = center`.
8. Set `minZ = radius * 0.01`, `maxZ = radius * 1000`.
9. Assign `scene.camera = cam`.

## Lifecycle: What Is Baked At Build Time

`registerScene` / `registerSceneWithShadowSupport` run the deferred group builders **once**
(`_built`); `unregisterScene` only detaches the scene from its surface's render list, so a
re-registration re-attaches rather than re-builds. What each category costs:

| Change after the initial build                                    | Takes effect                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light position / direction / colour / intensity                   | Immediately — the lights UBO is refreshed from `_lightVersion` every frame                                              |
| **Removing** or swapping a light                                  | Data: next frame (`_lightListVersion` invalidates the UBO). Baked state: rebuilt automatically on the next registration |
| Removing a shadow generator                                       | Rebuilt automatically on the next registration                                                                          |
| **Adding** a light, or attaching a generator to an existing light | Data: next frame (the light count changes). Baked state: only via an explicit `rebuildSceneRenderables(scene)`          |
| `mesh.material = …`                                               | Next frame, via the material-swap drain                                                                                 |

Baked per renderable at build time: the per-mesh light **index** list, the single- vs multi-light
shader permutation, whether the mesh receives shadows, and the shadow bind group of the generator
attached to each light. `rebuildSceneRenderables(scene)` re-runs the group builders so all of it is
recomputed. `removeFromScene` installs a rebuild hook that `buildScene` runs, so a **removal** is
picked up automatically on the scene's next registration and the natural flow works:

```ts
unregisterScene(scene);
removeFromScene(scene, oldLight); // its shadow generator goes with it — arms the rebuild
addToScene(scene, newLight); // with its own generator
await registerSceneWithShadowSupport(scene); // rebuilds, then re-attaches
```

A scene that only **adds** a light to an already-built scene installs no hook (keeping `addToScene`
free of rebuild bytes for every scene that never mutates topology) — call `rebuildSceneRenderables`
explicitly in that case.

Removing a shadow generator does **not** free its GPU resources inline: receiver renderables built
before the removal still bind them, so the teardown is queued on `_pendingTopologyRetirements` and
drained by an all-family rebuild (after the replacement bind groups exist) or by `disposeScene`. A
family-scoped rebuild (image processing → PBR only) deliberately never drains it.

Only group-owned renderables are replaced. Feature-owned entries in `_renderables` (skybox, ground,
HDR backdrop, Gaussian splats) are preserved: each `SceneMeshGroup` records its last build's output
in `group.o` — a group's meshes can be merged into one combined renderable with no `mesh`
back-reference, so ownership cannot be recovered by mesh identity. Node materials that captured
`shadowGenerators` at parse time keep their own references and are out of scope for a topology swap.
