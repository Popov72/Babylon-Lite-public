 *  without this bump a steady-state scene would keep rendering the previously uploaded
 *  view-projection.
 *
 *  Bumping `_projRev` is what makes the change reach the GPU: `_cameraChangeKey` folds it
 *  into that key. It is deliberately a *separate* counter from `worldMatrixVersion` — marking
 *  the camera transform dirty would additionally invalidate the camera's children and, under
 *  floating origin, retrigger origin rebasing across every renderable (`wrapRenderableForFO`),
 *  none of which a view-volume change warrants.
 *
