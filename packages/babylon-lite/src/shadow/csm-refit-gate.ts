/** CSM static-cache refit gate.
 *
 *  Pure per-frame decision logic for the CSM static shadow cache: which casters are
 *  static vs dynamic, when a caster is promoted or demoted between those sets, and
 *  whether this frame must refit the cascades (recompute cascade matrices and re-render
 *  the static cache) or only redraw the dynamic overlay.
 *
 *  Deliberately free of GPU and engine types so consumers can unit-test the gate with
 *  plain objects. The GPU orchestration (task membership moves, texture copies, camera
 *  updates) lives in `csm-shadow-task-hooks.ts`, which drives this gate through the
 *  promote/demote callbacks.
 *
 *  Correctness invariant owned by the caller: cascade matrices, the receiver UBO and
 *  the shadow-camera versions may change ONLY on frames where `update()` returns
 *  `refit: true`. The dynamic overlay is depth-tested against the cached static depth,
 *  so both halves must be rendered with the same cameras or the shadows tear.
