 * Runs the device-level half of recovery: acquire a replacement adapter/device, reconfigure
 * every surface, then hand off to the registered per-context recovery handlers.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT underscore-prefixed. This module is only reached through a dynamic
 * `import()` whose result is destructured, and a destructure is a property access — so the
 * scene bundler's Terser property mangler (`terserPropertyManglePlugin` in
 * `scripts/bundle-scenes-core.ts`, `regex: /^_[a-z]/`) rewrites the IMPORT side while the
 * export declaration, being a module binding, keeps its name. An `_lowerCamel` export
 * therefore resolves to `undefined` at runtime, and only in a minified bundle — dev and the
 * parity suite serve unmangled source. Same trap documented in `scene/scene-runtime-mesh-build.ts`
 * and `material/standard/std-mirrored-support.ts`. It stays out of `index.ts`, so it is not public API.

 * Rebuild every texture that recovery capture stamped, before any per-context handler runs.

 * layer atlases. That only covers textures something is currently drawing with. An app that owns a
 * recoverable texture outside those graphs (a sprite atlas page whose frames no `Sprite2DLayer`
 * references yet, an off-screen render target it swaps in later) would otherwise keep the lost
 * device's `GPUTexture` through a "successful" recovery, and the first `writeTexture` or draw
 * against it afterwards is a use-after-free that kills the browser's renderer process — with a
 * stack pointing at ordinary drawing code, arbitrarily long after the loss.
 *
 * Textures are tracked weakly, so this walks whatever is still alive and drops the rest. The
 * handlers' own walks still run; `rebuildTexture2D` is idempotent per device, so they no-op here
 * instead of rebuilding a second time.
 *
 * Returns the callback that carries each rebuilt texture's ownership onto its replacement, which
 * the caller runs after the handlers, or undefined when nothing was rebuilt. Nothing outside the
 * tracked set can be rebuilt later either: a texture with no `_recoverySource` is not tracked and
 * `rebuildTexture2D` returns for it, so an empty set means no handler can queue ownership either.
