 *
 *  The batch is detached from `_retirements` synchronously (so it cannot grow past its own fence)
 *  but parked in `_retiring` while the fence is pending, because a synchronous drain may still need
 *  to claim it: device-lost recovery MUST run these before it rebuilds anything, since the texture
 *  disposers capture `Texture2D` wrappers whose `texture` field recovery replaces in place.
 *
 *  The fence itself is acquired in a microtask so a caller that stops the engine from inside
 *  `onBeforeRender` still fences behind the in-flight frame's submit — `renderFrame` is synchronous,
 *  so the microtask lands after it. If the fence rejects (the device was lost), the batch is left in
 *  `_retiring` for recovery or teardown to claim rather than being run late against rebuilt
