 * A GPU pick records its draw against the pose of frame N, but the depth readback only resolves a
 * frame or two later, by which point the animation tick has advanced `skeleton.boneMatrices` and
 * `morphTargets.weights` in place. Resolving the hit triangle against those live mirrors would derive
 * the face normal from a different pose than the one that produced the hit. Capturing is O(bones +
 * targets) — independent of vertex count — so the picker can hold the drawn pose without the O(V)
