/** Splat sort worker.
 *
 *  Vite import: `import SortWorker from './splat-sort-worker.ts?worker&inline'`.
 *  The `?worker&inline` query keeps the bundled worker JS embedded as a base-64
 *  blob in the splat scene chunk — it adds zero bytes to any other scene
 *  because the whole `loader-splat/` module is dynamic-imported.
 *
 *  Protocol
 *  --------
 *  Init (once):  `{ p: Float32Array }`
 *                — buffer is transferred and retained on the worker side.
 *                — positions are in mesh-LOCAL space (stride 3, xyz per splat).
 *  Sort  (N×):   `{ t: Float32Array(4), o: Uint32Array }`
 *                — `o` is a transferable order buffer owned by the main thread's
 *                  pool (`mesh._orderPool`); the worker fills it with splat
 *                  indices in back-to-front order and transfers it back as
 *                  `{ o }`. The pool holds two buffers, so a second sort job can
 *                  be in flight while the previous result is still in transit —
 *                  the worker never idles on the round-trip during camera motion.
 *
 *  The sort itself is the uniform-key counting (radix) sort in
 *  `splat-sort-core.ts` (O(n)). `t` is the affine depth transform for
 *  `cameraForward · (world · localPos - cameraPos)`. */
