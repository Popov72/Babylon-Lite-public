/** The synthetic font-weight offset's shader fragment — the *only* WGSL this feature owns.
 *
 *  Every statement here is incremental: it declares what the base Slug shader does not have
 *  (a weight varying, an inflated quad, a distance solver, a bounded nearest-contour band
 *  scan, a coverage override) and nothing the base shader already provides. The fill/winding
 *  classification, the band walk, the root solve, the dilation and the color write all stay
 *  in the one shared template (`slug-shader.ts`), which interpolates these strings at its
 *  named slots.
 *
 *  Reachable only from `set-font-weight-offset.ts`, so a consumer that never imports
 *  `setFontWeightOffset` never carries any of this text.
 *
 *  ── Why this fragment owns a complete scan ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *  The base band loops answer a *winding* question, not a *nearest contour* question, and
 *  both of their optimizations are unsound for distance:
 *
 *    1. They read exactly one h-band (the band containing the pixel's y) and one v-band.
 *       That is complete for a +x / +y ray, which never leaves its own band. It is not
 *       complete for distance — the nearest contour to a pixel near a band boundary is
 *       routinely in the adjacent band.
 *    2. Inside a band they `break` as soon as a curve's max-x is more than half a pixel
 *       behind the pixel (curves are sorted by descending max-x). Those curves cannot
 *       cross the ray — but curves to the *left* of the pixel are exactly the ones that
 *       can be nearest to it.
 *
 *  Folding a running minimum into those loops therefore skips curves left of and below the
 *  pixel, which clips a positive (emboldening) offset on the right and top edges of a glyph
 *  and at all four corners. `wdst` below reads nothing from the base loops and does its own
 *  radius-bounded scan across every h-band the search radius touches. */
