/** Mirrored-mesh support, reached only through the public `enableMirroredMeshes()` opt-in.
 *
 *  Everything here is additive to the glTF loader's built-in winding handling:
 *   - a winding rule derived from the live world determinant, so procedural meshes and meshes
 *     mirrored after load are covered too (the loader only flags glTF nodes, once, at load time);
 *   - the Standard pipeline's primitive resolver, which otherwise has no winding reversal at all;
 *   - a per-scene watcher that re-resolves a mesh's pipeline when its determinant sign flips.
 *
 *  Kept out of every non-opting bundle: nothing in the engine imports this module statically, and
 *  `enableMirroredMeshes()` reaches it through a dynamic import. */
