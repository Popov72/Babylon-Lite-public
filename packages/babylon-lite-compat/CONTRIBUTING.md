# Contributing to @babylonjs/lite-compat

This document is for **maintainers** of the compatibility layer. If you just want
to _consume_ the package, see [README.md](./README.md).

The compat layer is largely **maintained by an AI agent**: a Copilot-driven skill
reconciles it against upstream Babylon.js / Babylon Lite changes and lands new lab
scenes at parity. Private automation in `microsoft/babylonjs-eng` polls approved
requests and opens draft PRs for human review. Humans are needed for the parts that
require a real GPU or judgment — running parity/perf tests and reviewing/merging PRs.

## COMPAT-STATUS.md — the single source of truth

[COMPAT-STATUS.md](./COMPAT-STATUS.md) is the live record of what the layer
supports and how far it has been reconciled against upstream. Everything else —
the skill, private automation, and the README table — reads from or updates it.

It tracks three things:

1. **Upstream sync markers.** `Last synced BJS commit` records the
   `BabylonJS/Babylon.js` `master` HEAD the surface was last reconciled against,
   `Last synced Lite commit` records the Babylon Lite commit it was reconciled
   against, and `Last sync date` records when. All three are **machine-read** by
   the skill — do not rename them, and rewrite all three at the end of every sync.
2. **Lab-scene coverage.** The _Lab scene coverage_ section lists which oracle
   scenes render at pixel parity (MAD ≈ 0) through the compat layer, and the
   blocker for the rest.
3. **API parity.** A per-area status matrix with a `✅ / ⚡ / 🔧 / ❌` row for
   every public symbol of `@babylonjs/core` and `@babylonjs/loaders` (the
   completeness invariant: every public symbol has a row).

> **Scope is `@babylonjs/core` + `@babylonjs/loaders` only.** Everything else
> (`gui`, `inspector`, `post-processes`, `serializers`, WebXR, audio, …) is out
> of scope. A few historical out-of-core rows are kept for reader context but are
> not part of the audited surface.

## The `update-compat-layer` skill

[`.github/copilot/skills/update-compat-layer.md`](../../.github/copilot/skills/update-compat-layer.md)
is the skill that advances the layer. Every run makes progress on three fronts:

| Task                                      | Goal                                                                   | Tracked in `COMPAT-STATUS.md` by                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 — Upstream diffs**                    | React to what changed in Babylon.js + Babylon Lite since the last sync | the `Last synced BJS commit` / `Last synced Lite commit` / `Last sync date` markers |
| **2 — Lab-scene coverage** (required win) | Land **at least one** more oracle scene at MAD ≈ 0                     | the _Lab scene coverage_ section                                                    |
| **3 — API parity**                        | Add/upgrade core + loaders symbols (real impl or honest stub)          | the per-area status matrix                                                          |

Task 2 is the headline deliverable of every run: a run that ships zero new working
scenes is considered incomplete.

When you change the surface, keep the layer **honest**: an unsupported API should
throw `LiteCompatError` (via the `unsupported()` helper) rather than silently
mis-rendering, and the matching row in `COMPAT-STATUS.md` must be updated in the
same change.

The skill also keeps the consumer-facing **Supported APIs at a glance** table in
[README.md](./README.md) in sync: that table is a per-feature-area roll-up of the
`COMPAT-STATUS.md` matrix, so whenever a change flips an area's overall status it
updates the README row too (without leaking per-symbol detail or internal-doc
links, since the README ships to npm).

## Marking a lab scene ready for compat

The repo's lab renders the Babylon.js oracle scenes (`lab/lite/src/bjs/sceneN.ts`)
through the compat layer at `/compat/sceneN.html` — see the **Compat** tab in the
lab. This is the behavioural cross-check for the API surface.

A scene is opted into the Compat tab by setting `"compatParity": true` on its entry
in [scene-config.json](../../scene-config.json):

```jsonc
{
    "id": 1,
    "slug": "scene1-boombox",
    "name": "Scene 1 — BoomBox PBR",
    // …
    "compatParity": true, // ← renders through the compat layer in the Compat tab
}
```

How the redirect works: the lab's `compatScenesPlugin`
([lab/vite.config.ts](../../lab/vite.config.ts)) serves the parallel
`/compat/sceneN.html` route and rewrites the scene's `@babylonjs/*` imports onto
the compat layer using the **same shared mapping table** (`bundler-resolve.ts`,
via `mapBabylonImport`) that backs the published bundler plugins — so the lab
harness and the shipped Vite/Rollup/Webpack/esbuild plugins validate the exact
same redirects.

Only flip `compatParity` to `true` once the compat render matches the native Lite
port at MAD ≈ 0, and add the scene to the _Working_ list in `COMPAT-STATUS.md`.
Scenes with no Babylon.js oracle source (Lite-only scenes) are excluded.

## Automated maintenance

The private `microsoft/babylonjs-eng` automation polls this repository for approved
compat requests, runs the `update-compat-layer` skill, and opens a **draft PR** for
human review. It reports workflow status and actionable failure feedback on the
originating issue; it does not require a cross-organization dispatch or Microsoft
credential in this public repository.

- **Routing and authorization are separate.** `compat` routes an issue to the compat
  workflow. A Babylon contributor applies `agent-approved` to authorize the exact
  title/body snapshot. The generic
  [.github/workflows/agent-approval.yml](../../.github/workflows/agent-approval.yml)
  verifies that approver has `triage`, `write`, `maintain`, or `admin` permission and
  posts the attestation with the repository `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **Approval is immutable.** The digest is the lowercase UTF-8 SHA-256 of
  `JSON.stringify({version:1,issue_number:<number>,title:<title>,body:<body-or-empty-string>})`
  with that exact JavaScript insertion order. The marker is
  `<!-- agent-approval:v1 issue=<decimal> sha256=<64 lowercase hex> approver=<login> approved-at=<ISO timestamp> -->`.
  The poller accepts only comments authored by `github-actions[bot]` with actor type
  `Bot`, and requires the current issue to carry both `compat` and `agent-approved`
  with a digest matching its current content.
- **Edits require reapproval.** Editing an approved issue removes only
  `agent-approved` and posts one invalidation notice; `compat` remains as the routing
  label. The poller's own hash comparison remains authoritative against races.
- **Dispatch uses the approved snapshot.** After rechecking labels, bot identity, and
  digest, the private poller passes that immutable title/body snapshot to the
  compat-maintenance workflow. The resulting changes arrive as a draft PR, and
  status or failure feedback returns to the originating issue.
- **Machine-read sync state remains in `COMPAT-STATUS.md`.** Every successful sync
  rewrites `Last synced BJS commit`, `Last synced Lite commit`, and `Last sync date`;
  do not rename those markers or turn the file into a run log.
- **Humans stay in the loop** for draft-PR review and GPU-bound parity/performance
  checks.

## Local development

```sh
# Unit tests (GPU-free): math, observables, engine/scene APIs, bundler resolver
pnpm exec vitest run --project compat

# Typecheck the package against the linked babylon-lite types
pnpm exec tsc -p packages/babylon-lite-compat/tsconfig.json --noEmit

# Build the publishable dist (ESM + .d.ts)
pnpm --filter @babylonjs/lite-compat build

# Run the lab to compare /compat/sceneN against /lite/sceneN
pnpm --filter lab dev
```

CI runs the compat unit tests + typecheck + build on every PR (the **Compat Layer**
job in [azure-pipelines.yml](../../azure-pipelines.yml)); it does **not** publish
the package. Pixel-parity and bundle-size gates run in the lab/CI on a real GPU.
